The solution involves proper use of parentheses to control the order of operations and ensure units are handled correctly within the `calc()` function.  Spaces should be included around the operators (+, -, *, /) inside the `calc()` function. 

Here is the corrected code:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% + 100px); /* Correct: Parentheses ensure addition happens after percentage calculation */
}

.another-element {
  height: calc(100vh - 50px); /* Correct: subtraction is correctly processed */
}
```

This ensures that calculations are performed as intended and prevents unexpected results. Always carefully consider unit types (px, %, em, etc.) and their interaction within the calculation.
